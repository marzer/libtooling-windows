# libtooling-windows

This repository contains a self-contained build of clang's libTooling for use with windows targets on visual studio.

## Notes

-   Included are static libs for Win32 and AMD64, intended to be used in an MSVC-oriented context.
-   The debug libs have been built with minor optimizations turned on, because otherwise they're just too chunky.
    This should be fine in the general case. If not, build it yourself ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
